# hello-world
first repository


Hello readers, UG101 here on github for the first time.

I took a class in Video Game Design and JavaScript, and I got recommended to this site without the person knowing they recommended me.

I like reading, writing, playing games, and creating mods and texture packs for minecraft pocket edition.
